Welcome to VR Gamer! This is nothing but a little guide of sorts to give the user a short list of top 10 new Virtural Reality games to play for the new year of 2020, with information provided by the website:  "https://store.steampowered.com/vr/#p=0&tab=NewReleases"

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cli_project'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cli_project

## Usage

After starting the program, when prompt, you choose a number ranging from 1 - 10 with each number representing a game title. From there, you will recieve information based on the title. The information provided is the Name, Price, Tags, and Description of the game. The user can type "list" to return back to the numbered list of game titles or "exit" to exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/games` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
